	<div class='page_head'>Welcome to the StageX video site Beta!</div>
	<div class='caption_text'>This site is a video site. No denying it, there are a lot of video sites out there; so how would I define StageX as different?</div>

			<h3>Keep the flamin' going throughout the entire conversation</h3>
			Being able to view the direct parent of a comment and the individual thread of a comment and its replies comes real handy when you want to keep track of long and grinding
			flame fights with other users. Now with StageX you can carry on the conversation all night long without ever losing track!
		</div>
		<div class='grid_5'>
			<h3>Simple</h3>
			Youtube and Vimeo as well as many other sites have so many functions that they have been rendered almost useless as entities since the average user only uses about 5% of all functions
			provided. StageX has tried to simplify video sites but at the same time give you, the user, the power to control your content. There is also no beating around the bush, StageX will
			try to make your life easy around here.
		</div>
		<div class='grid_5 omega'>
			<h3>Keep up with people</h3>
			StageX provides news on most actions so you fans can keep up with you no matter what, from uploading videos to compiling playlists.
			What's even better is that you can then let people stalk you on Facebook and Twitter by auto-sharing your StageX news!
		</div>

			<h3>Page through and search your stuff</h3>
			Stagex not only pages both your videos and playlists but it also provides a very handy search feature on those pages to allow you to actually find what your looking for instead of
			searching for a video called "20111_445" with the query "2011" in your library on Youtube and Vimeo and finding god damn nothing when the video is right there in front of you!
		</div>
		<div class='grid_5'>
			<h3>Keep upto date</h3>
			StageX has a real notifications system that really lets you know about things going down in your hood to give you more power over
			the content you put here.
		</div>
		<div class='grid_5 omega'>
			<h3>Simple communication</h3>
			StageX provides two ways for people to communicate, either directly through your stream (wall) or by comenting on something you've interacted with.
