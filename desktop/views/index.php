			<h3>Keep your Privacy</h3>
			<p>We don't demand you fork out your real name or a full Facebook or Google+ profile. We only ask for three pieces of information:- username, password and email address. 
			Filling in the rest is upto you!</p>
		</div></div>
		<div class='grid-col-16'><div>
			<h3>Stay Safe</h3>
			<p>Near anonymity does not compromise safety. StageX does not rely on potentially false and/or fake information supplied on a 
			user profile to track individuals who wish to ruin the community.</p>

			<h3>Simple</h3>
			<p>Youtube and Vimeo as well as many other sites have so many functions that the average user only uses about 5% of the site and is confused by the other 95%.
			There is no beating around the bush, StageX will try to make your life easier.</p>
		</div></div>
		<div class='grid-col-16'><div>
			<h3>Pagination and Search</h3>
			<p>Stagex not only pages both your videos and playlists but it also provides a very handy search feature on those pages to allow you to actually find what your looking for instead of
			searching for a video called "20111_445" with the query "2011" in your library on Youtube and Vimeo and finding god damn nothing when the video is right there in front of you!</p>
